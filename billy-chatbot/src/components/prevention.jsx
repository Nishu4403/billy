          <p className="m-6 text-xl text-justify">
          Most social media platforms offer privacy settings that allow users to control who can see their posts, comment on them, or message them. Make sure to adjust these settings to protect your personal information and limit access to your online profiles.
          </p>

          Most social media platforms, websites, and online services have built-in tools to report harmful or abusive behavior.
